- 👋 Hi, I’m Tyler Beauregard, a PhD student at the Ohio State University.
- 👀 I’m interested in improving communication in acute medical care and emergency settings, especially in settings where it's hard to get a computer/internet access.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything related to this! I'm brand new. My entire "computer science background" is pushing buttons on my computer and seeing what it does.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on electronic medical records.
